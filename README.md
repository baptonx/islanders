# Islanders game

This game is part of a group project made during my Angular web developpement and testing course at INSA Rennes. It consists of a 2D isometric game where the goal is to place buildings and terrain to earn points. 

##Technologies used

The app is divided into a front-end part and a back-end part. It contains :
- an Angular front-end (user interface)
- a Jersey Java REST API back-end used with Maven

## Layout

`game-bundle` contains scripts to use for each delivery: edit them to set up your names.

`game-backend` is backend of the application. It contains th Java code of the server.
It is in charge with providing a REST API.

`game-frontend` is the Angular front-end (user interface) of the application.

`game-doc` is the folder that will contain your reports (and its pictures) and the user documentation.

`code-examples` contains several projects that will help in conducting the projet (Angular and Jackson examples).
